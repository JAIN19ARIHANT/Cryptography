This repository contains implementations of various cryptographic algorithms and ciphers. It serves as a collection of lab work and personal study in the field of cryptography.

## üöÄ About The Project

The goal of this repository is to explore the fundamentals of cryptography by building classic and modern ciphers from scratch. Each lab focuses on a specific algorithm, providing a clear Java implementation and explaining the underlying principles.

This project starts with one of the most foundational ciphers in history and will be expanded over time.

## üìÇ Labs Overview

This repository is structured into different labs, each covering a unique topic.

| Lab Number | Topic                                   | Status      |
| :--------- | :-------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| **Lab 1** | **Shift Cipher (Caesar Cipher)** | ‚úÖ Complete |
| **Lab 2** |  | ‚è≥ Pending  |
| **Lab 3** |  | ‚è≥ Pending  |

## Lab 1: The Shift Cipher (Caesar Cipher)

The first lab implements the **Shift Cipher**, also famously known as the Caesar Cipher. It is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is "shifted" a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

### üß† How It Works

The core idea is to replace each character with another character a fixed number of positions away in the alphabet. For a given plaintext character $P$, a secret key (shift) $k$, the encrypted character $C$ is calculated as:

$$ E_k(P) = (P + k) \mod 26 $$

Decryption is the reverse process:

$$ D_k(C) = (C - k) \mod 26 $$

This implementation handles both uppercase and lowercase letters, preserving case, while non-alphabetic characters are ignored.

### üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
* [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/)

#### Installation

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/JAIN19ARIHANT/Cryptography.git](https://github.com/JAIN19ARIHANT/Cryptography.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd Cryptography
    ```

### üíª Usage

1.  Navigate to the `Lab1` directory:
    ```sh
    cd Lab1
    ```
2.  Compile the Java source file:
    ```sh
    javac ShiftCipher.java
    ```
3.  Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    java ShiftCipher
    ```

The program will then prompt you to enter a plaintext message and a shift key to perform the encryption and subsequent decryption.

#### Example Execution

```
Enter the plaintext to encrypt: hello world
Enter the shift key (an integer): 3

--- Results ---
Plaintext:  hello world
Shift Key:  3
Ciphertext: KHOOR ZRUOG
Decrypted:  hello world
```
